# Web Scraping Books from https://books.toscrape.com
This is a Python script that demonstrates how to scrape book titles and prices from https://books.toscrape.com using the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries. The script navigates through multiple pages of book listings to extract the desired data.

## Requirements
To run the script, you'll need the following:
`Python (>=3.6)`
`requests library`
`beautifulsoup4 library`
You can install the required libraries using pip:
